## Workflow
1. Pull latest `main`, branch from it.
2. Commit with Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).
3. Open a PR; paste a screenshot or preview link if available.
4. Wait for 1 review; mentors merge.

## Local dev
- Serve statically (no backend): `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

## Style
- Prettier on save, accessible by keyboard, clear focus styles.
