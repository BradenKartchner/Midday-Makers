## ‚ùì **Anticipated Questions & Answers**

### "How is this different from other habit trackers?"
**Answer**: "Most habit trackers focus on big goals that are hard to maintain. We focus on 2-minute micro-habits that are almost impossible to fail at. The XP system provides immediate rewards, and the badge system creates long-term motivation."

### "What happens if users miss days?"
**Answer**: "That's the beauty of micro-habits - they're so small that missing a day doesn't feel like failure. The daily XP resets, but total XP and badges remain, so users never lose their overall progress."

### "Can this scale to many users?"
**Answer**: "Absolutely. Since everything runs in the browser with local storage, each user is essentially running their own instance. No server load, no database costs, infinite scalability."

### "What about mobile users?"
**Answer**: "The application is fully responsive and works great on mobile devices. Users can check off habits on their phone throughout the day."

### "How do you prevent users from gaming the system?"
**Answer**: "The habits reset daily, and the real value comes from building actual habits, not accumulating points. Users who game the system only cheat themselves out of real behavior change."

### "What's the technical maintenance requirement?"
**Answer**: "Minimal. It's static files that can be hosted anywhere. No databases to maintain, no servers to monitor, no user accounts to manage."
