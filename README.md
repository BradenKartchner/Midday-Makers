# Midday-Makers

## Project Summary

**Vibe Code** is a web app created in just **4 days** as part of a hackathon challenge to build something **SLC: Simple, Lovable, and Complete**, inspired by the [SLC philosophy](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/).

Built under the theme **"Future Focused: Tiny Tech for Your Future Self,"** this project is a testament to what can happen when a small team leans into creativity, collaboration, and just enough structure to build something real — and something people actually enjoy.

- **Simple** – No bloat, no overengineering — just what matters.
- **Lovable** – We focused on personality, playfulness, and user-first interactions.
- **Complete** – Delivered end-to-end with working features, polish, and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **React** – For building composable, reactive UI components
- **JavaScript** – For expressive, client-side logic and functionality
- **Vite** – For fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** – For utility-first styling
- **Vitest** – For unit testing
- **Prettier** - For project formatting
